## 💡 Key Concepts Explained:

### What is GOOGLE_API_KEY?
```
Your password to use Google's search service
Format: AIzaSyD-xxxxxxxxxxx...
Where: In .env file
Why: Identifies your app to Google
```

### What is GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID (CX)?
```
Your search engine configuration ID
Format: a1234567890:abcdefghijk
Where: In .env file
Why: Tells Google which search settings to use
```

### What does "Not Configured" mean?
```
Flask started before .env was loaded
Or .env file not found
Or variables have wrong names
Solution: Restart Flask, verify .env location
```

### Why use Google API?
```
✅ Real market prices (not just category average)
✅ Higher confidence levels
✅ More accurate valuations
✅ Better user experience
```
